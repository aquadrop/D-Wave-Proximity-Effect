\section{Control System for Raman Stage and Fresnel Rhomb} 
The software I designed integrates the XYZ stage control panel and the Fresnel Rhomb control panel. Users can operate XYZ stage and the Fresnel Rhomb at the same time with convenience.
    For XYZ stage control part, apart from controlling the stage, users can store the positions of their samples that may be studied later.
    For Fresnel control part, the digits shown on the software are really polarization angles so that users do not need to convert the units. In addition, a polarization clock is provided to assist the operation. What is more, the COM interface is also adjustable even in the case that the software is installed in a substituted computer.
