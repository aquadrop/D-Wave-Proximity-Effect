We conclude our work of calculating $d$-wave tunnelling spectroscopy and fitting the experimental data as well as the calculation the tunnelling spectroscopy accounting for proximity effect.

For the work described in Chapter 2, first of all we need to modify our model. As stated at the end of Chapter 2, the density of states is assumed to be constant, which might probably not be true. Also, we need to perform a calculation using genetic algorithm which is more reliable.

For the work calculating the proximity effect, though it reproduces quite well for the special cases, the picture of reduced gap and induced gap is blurred; we do not have a clear idea of what their effects are. Moreover, we need to have a deeper study of the $d$-wave tunnelling spectroscopy with proximity effect.
